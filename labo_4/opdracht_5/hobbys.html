    </li>
    <li>The last item on my list is Chess. However, I do not consider this as a real hobby since I am not a member
      of a chess club. I only play online chess on <a href="https://www.chess.com/">Chess.com</a> and <a href="https://lichess.org/">lichess.org</a>.
      My ELO-rating is about 1200-1300.
