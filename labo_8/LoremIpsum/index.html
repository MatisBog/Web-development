  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
  remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
  Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
  publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

  <p>It is a long-established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
  readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
  ÂµLorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
  as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
  readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use
  Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
  uncover many websites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
  over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

<p><strong>Je zult merken dat de kolommen niet naast elkaar, maar onder elkaar staan. Waarom is dit zo?</strong></p>
<p>Omdat in die 50% de marges en de padding niet zijn meegerekend. Dus je tekst zal 50% van de pagina innemen en als je (standaard) margin of padding toevoegd is dat uiteindelijk meer dan 50%</p>
